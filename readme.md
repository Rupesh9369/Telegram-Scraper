### 8. **Update `setup.py` with Your Credentials**

Edit the `setup.py` file and update the following fields:

- `phone_number` = `"+91xxxxxxxxxxxxx"`
- `app_id` = `"12345555555"`
- `api_hash` = `"1d554xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx4813fxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"`

Run the script and follow the prompt to enter the OTP sent to your Telegram account:

```bash
python setup.py

- Enter your own group link (e.g., `https://t.me/joinchat/XXXXXXX`).
- Provide the name of the `members.csv` file.

If you want to change the number of members added at a time (default is 50), update this line in `add.py`:

```python
def read_members(file_path, limit=50):

Change the `limit` to your desired number (e.g., 100 or more). The default value of 50 is recommended for optimal performance.
